// The browser surface the monitor needs.
//
// It is a subset of the X reply engine's XBrowser in nextbrowser-app
// (src/lib/xreply/browser.ts), so the app can hand the monitor the same
// nextctl-backed browser it already builds for a prepared profile. Outside the
// app, src/node/nbc.ts implements it over the nbc CLI.
//
// LinkedIn is read from the pages it draws, not from data: what a member sees
// is gated behind a signed-in session, LinkedIn's own data calls (Voyager)
// carry per-session tokens and change shape without notice, and its public API
// gives none of this to a member's own tools. So the monitor opens a page in
// the profile's tab, waits until LinkedIn has drawn it, and reads it through
// the DOM: a tab, a way to navigate it, a way to wait, and a way to evaluate a
// script.
//
// Nothing here may depend on Node: the app runs its engines in the renderer.
