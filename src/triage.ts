// Urgency triage: which of the items a pass found deserve an answer first.
//
// The rules are few, fixed and written out, on purpose: a person deciding
// what to answer first has to be able to see why the monitor put an item on
// top. Every rule adds points and a reason in plain words; the points pick
// the level. No model is involved and nothing leaves the machine.
//
//   mentions the account                                            +4
//   replies to the account's comment                                +4
//   names your company                                              +3
//   comments on the account's own post                              +2
//   asks for a recommendation ("looking for", "alternative to",
//   "who do you use") — on LinkedIn, a B2B lead                     +2
//   says one of the urgent terms ("outage", "refund", …), when it
//   is about you: addressed to the account, naming your company,
//   or naming a keyword                                             +3
//   asks a question                                                 +1
//   a lead or a post about you that nobody has commented on yet     +1
//   a post picking up fast: 30 or more comments since the last look +1

//   4 or more: high · 2–3: medium · otherwise: low
